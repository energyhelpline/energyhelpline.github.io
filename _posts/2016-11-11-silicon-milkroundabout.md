We're always on the lookout for top tech talent and as such we'll be sending a team of developers to Silicon Milkroundabout to hover up everything that London's awesome dev community has to offer!

It's being held at Old Trumen Brewery on Brick Lane in East London (check out [their site](https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com/) for further details and registration) on Sunday 27th November.

Silicon Milkroundabout is a great way to find out more about some companies that you're heard about and some that you haven't and to speak to the people who work for the companies represented - people who could be your new team mates!

Register on the [Silicon Milkroundabout website](https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com/) and then come and talk to our developers about what it's like to work at energyhelpline.  We'll be the ones wearing the 'I'm on 20% time' t-shirts!  Enter our prize draw for a chance to win a DAS keyboard ultimate!
