After a little over a year working at Energy Helpline, I thought it time to reflect on my time here. I am thoroughly
enjoying my time here - I get to work on some interesting things with a great deal on autonomy and I get to do so with a bunch of smart and friendly people.  I like the way we work - agile, test focused, taking pride in our craft, helping the business reach its objectives.

The one thing I really love about working at Energy Helpline is its attitude to learning and training. The main strand of this is what we call Twenty Percent Time. This means one day a week we stop working on features and instead spend that day learning or working on any thing of our choice. We do this every week without fail.
