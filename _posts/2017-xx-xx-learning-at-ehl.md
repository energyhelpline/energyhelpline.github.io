After a little over a year working at Energy Helpline, I thought it time to reflect on my time here. I am thoroughly
enjoying my time here  - I get to work on some interesting things with a great deal on autonomy and I get to do so with a bunch of willing, friendly and intelligent people.  I like the way we work - agile, test focused, taking pride in our craft, helping the business reach its objectives.

The one thing I really love about Energy Helpline is its attitude to learning and training.
